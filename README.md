> Quote, Shorten, Tweet

QST allows you to instantly share selected text on Twitter. The extension adds a little item to your context (right-click) menu. It quotes the selected text, together with a shortened URL of the current page into a new tweet.

Shortening requires a [Bitly](bitly.com) account but is totally optional. Custom domains are supported too!
